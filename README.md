# COVID-19 Models and Analysis
This project aims to provide detailed statistical analysis and create accurate predictive models of the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary predictive model is a regression model that predicts the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in the U.S. 

This project was created using Python (in Jupyter Notebooks), JavaScript (in Google Scripts), and Bash (in text editor).

## Background
COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The first outbreak of COVID-19 occured in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Since then, the outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the WHO and the disease has been spreading easily and sustainably in communities all around the world. 

Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a somewhat predictable progression that includes 5 main phases. 

First comes the *investigation* phase, and then the *recognition*, *initiation*, and *acceleration* phases. At the end of the acceleration phase, the pandemic is at its peak. After the peak occurs, there will be a decrease in illnesses. This decrease occurs during the final phase: the *deceleration* phase. Different countries (or parts of the same country) can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time.

## 1) Collecting Data
Predicting the number of cases or deaths caused by COVID-19 is a regression problem that requires supervised learning. Data regarding COVID-19 has been publicly available since mid-January of 2020 (see pRESOURCES \[1\]](#resources)). This data is used as the basis to create the regression models on the outbreak. I am using 6 attributes/features to create the hypothesis function.
















This project is not necessarily meant for others to use as a reliable resource/reference, but rather for my own understanding and apprehension of machine learning modelling and detailed statistical analysis.
